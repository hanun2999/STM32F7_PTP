# Precision Time Protocol on STM32F7
This repository contains Precision Time Protocol project for STM32F769NIH6 microcontroller.
The project is developed using STM32CubeIDE and aims for working PTP application on STM32F769 Discovery kit. The purpose is to achieve as precise synchronisation as possible between two Discovery boards.
